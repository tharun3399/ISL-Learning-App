# Premium Login UI (React + Vite)

This is a minimal React + Vite project containing a premium-looking login page with email/password fields, forgot password, and social sign-in buttons (Google, GitHub, Facebook).

Quick start (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
cd C:/Users/SSN/Desktop/mylogin
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the shown URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`) in your browser.

Notes:
- This is a frontend-only UI; social buttons are UI-only and do not implement actual OAuth flows.
- You can wire the form and social buttons to your auth backend or provider SDK as needed.
